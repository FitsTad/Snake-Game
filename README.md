# Snake-Game

Brief Discription of the Snake Game

The user starts out with a snake (typically of a short length) on a 2D grid with a randomly placed apple. The snake can move in any of the four directions (except turning into itself), and each block of the snake will replace the block ahead of it on each movement cycle. Crossing over an apple increases the length of the snake. Running the snake into itself or into a wall will end the game. The objective of the game is to consume as many apples as possible.
